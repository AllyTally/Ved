In this mode, you can draw\n          walls and backgrounds and the edges will automatically get placed\n          correctly. However, while editing in this mode, all walls and\n          backgrounds in the room must use the same tileset and color.\n\n     Multi-tileset mode\\h#1\n\n          This is similar to automatic mode, except that you can have multiple\n          different tilesets in the same room. That is, changing the tileset will\n          not affect already-placed walls and backgrounds, and you can draw in\n          multiple different types of tiles in the same room.\n\n     Manual mode\\h#2\n\n          Also called Direct Mode, in this mode you can place down any tile\n          manually, so you are not bound to the pre-defined tileset combinations\n          and edges will not automatically get added to walls, giving you complete\n          control over how the room will look. However, this editing mode is often\n          slower to use.\n"

This can be done in combination with the ¤\nsystem described above, note that regular text colors start the next \"block\",\nbut background colors do not. The following examples use spaces to make everything\nmore readable, but this is completely optional.

Links use the semi-color code¤ l¤. This code does not switch\\nY\nto the next \"colored block\", it only applies to the current one, as opposed to\nregular (non-background) color codes. It also does not change color, so you can\nchange the style of the link to anything you want.\n\nYou can link to articles by simply using the name of the article:\n\n\\-\nTools\\bl\\\n\nTools\\bl\n\\-\n\nClicking the \"Tools\" above will bring you to the Tools help article. I used the\ncolor code¤ b ¤here to make the link blue, and as you can see, the¤ l ¤applies to\\nbnY\nthat same colored part.\n\nYou can link to anchors in the same article by linking to a¤ # ¤followed by all text\\nY\non that line. (Instances of¤ ¤¤ ¤are completely ignored there.) You can link to the\\nY\ntop of the article with just a hash character (¤#§¤).\\nY(\n\n\\-\n#Using multiple colors on a line\\bl\\\n\n#Using multiple colors on a line\\bl\n\\-\n\nYou can link to an anchor in a different article in a similar way:\n\n\\-\nLists reference#Gamestates\\bl\\\n\nLists reference#Gamestates\\bl\n\\-\n\nLinking to websites is straightforward too:\n\n\\-\nhttps://example.com/\\bl\\\n\nhttps://example.com/\\bl\n\\-\n\nYou can use a color block with color code¤ L ¤that contains the actual destination\\nY\nbefore the link text, and make the link show a different text that way:\n\n\\-\nTools¤¤Go to another article\\Lbl\\\n\nTools¤Go to another article\\Lbl\n\\-\nClick ¤¤Tools¤¤here¤¤ to go to another article\\nLbl\\\n\nClick ¤Tools¤here¤ to go to another article\\nLbl\n\\-\n[¤¤#Links¤¤Like¤¤] [¤¤#Example:¤¤Dislike¤¤]\\n L vl n L rl\\\n\n[¤#Links¤Like¤] [¤#Example:¤Dislike¤]\\n L vl n L rl\n\\-\n#Links¤¤ Button A ¤¤ §¤¤#Links¤¤ Button B \\L w&Zl n L w&Z l(\\\n\n#Links¤ Button A ¤ §¤#Links¤ Button B \\L w&Zl n L w&Z l(\n\\-\n\nImages (only available in plugin\\h#\n\ndescriptions):\\h\n\n0..9 - display image 0..9 on this line (array index in the imgs array starts at 0,\n       and remember to keep lines blank to accommodate for the image height)\n^ - Put this before the image number, shift image number by 10.
